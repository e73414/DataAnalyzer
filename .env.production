# Production environment for Docker Compose
# These URLs are accessed from the BROWSER, not from within Docker
# So they need to be the externally accessible URLs

# Option A: If accessing from the same machine as Docker host
VITE_MCP_N8N_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_MCP_POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Option B: If accessing from another device on your network
# Replace with your server's IP address
# VITE_MCP_N8N_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
# VITE_MCP_POCKETBASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3001

# Option C: If using a reverse proxy with domain names
# VITE_MCP_N8N_URL=https://mcp-n8n.yourdomain.com
# VITE_MCP_POCKETBASE_URL=https://mcp-pocketbase.yourdomain.com
